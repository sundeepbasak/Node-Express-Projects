//JWT is just a way to exchange data(in a secure way) between two parties â€” a client and a server.
//It can be used as an access token to prevent unwanted access to a protected resource. They are often used as Bearer tokens, which the API will decide and validate before sending a response.
//JWT consists of 3 parts: Header, Payload, Signature

//console.log(decoded) -->
//looks like this: { id: 17, username: 'sundeep', iat: 1660675640, exp: 1663267640 }
